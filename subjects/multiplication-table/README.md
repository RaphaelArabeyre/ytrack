### Multiplication table

### Explanations

Loops execute a block of code a specific number of times, or while a specific state is true.

When you write code, you want the same block of code to work over and over again. Instead of adding several almost equal lines in a script we will use loops to do this task! ðŸ˜ƒ

In PHP the following elements create loops :

- while (tant que) - execute loops for a block of code while a specific state is true

- do...while - execute loops for a block of code once, and then repeat the loop as long as a specific state is true

- for (pour) - executes loops for a block of code a specific number of times

- foreach - loops for a block of code for each element in a series

#### While loop

The while loop executes a block of code as long as a condition is true.

Syntax :

```php
while (condition) {
    //code to be executed;
}
```

### Instructions

Using a `while` loop display the multiplication table of 9.

Expected result :

```php
1 * 9 = 9
2 * 9 = 18
3 * 9 = 27
4 * 9 = 36
5 * 9 = 45
6 * 9 = 54
7 * 9 = 63
8 * 9 = 72
9 * 9 = 81
10 * 9 = 90
```

**The script must be a maximum of 6 lines**

You are not allowed to use the 'range' function.

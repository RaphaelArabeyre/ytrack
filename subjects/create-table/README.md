## create-table

## Welcome!

Welcome to the SQL Pool. The idea of this pool is to introduce you to SQL by manipulating a database. In order to realize, you can download the database [here](https://github.com/thomaslenaour/ytrack/blob/main/sql/tests/db/chinook.db). Once this is done, you can download software such as [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com/) for example to perform your SQL queries.

Good luck !

### Arithmetic operators

### Explanations

There are five **basic** arithmetic operators :

| Operator |      Name      |  Example |                         Result |
| :------- | :------------: | -------: | -----------------------------: |
| +        |    Addition    |  $x + $y |              Sum of $x and $y. |
| -        |  Substraction  |  $x - $y |       Difference of $x and $y. |
| \*       | Multiplication | $x \* $y |          Product of $x and $y. |
| /        |    Division    |  $x / $y |         Quotient of$ x and $y. |
| %        |     Modulo     |  $x % $y | Remainder of $x divided by $y. |

### Instructions

Create the following variables with the following operators and numbers:

```php
$firstNbr = 100;
$secondNbr = 35;
```

- `firstSum` The sum of two numbers
- `firstSub` The subtraction of two numbers
- `firstMult` The multiplication of two numbers
- `firstDivision` The division of two numbers
- `firstModulus` The modulo of two numbers
